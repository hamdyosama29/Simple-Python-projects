# 1. **Simple calculator**
#### 1. I added the function ```try``` so that if it sees any error, it disables the program so as not to cause problems with the user.
#### 2. A variable named Cal was written. This variable contains True so that the loop runs all the time 
#### 3. A variable named enter has been declared so that I can receive the calculation from it later 
#### 4. I added the conditional expression if so that if a person wants to exit the program, he can type exit 
#### 5. I added another condition because I noticed that when I ran the program without this condition, there was a problem with the division, which is that if I wrote it as an example of this ```10/2```, the output would appear with me in this form ```5.0` ``And I don't want it to appear like this. I solved it by adding this condition: pressing on ```/````, if it finds it, replaces it with this command, which is ```//```Because in this matter, the quotient of the division ```5``` appears to me like this
#### 6. If nothing happens, it converts that text into a number through the ```eval``` function so that I can calculate it. 
#### 7. I added ```except``` to ````try```, then I called this command from within ```Exception``` and stored a variable for it so that I could call it later to show me what It is the form by adjusting and adding the letter ```f``` so that I can add a variable inside the text
***

# 2. **Even and odd numbers testing program**
#### 1. I added the function ```try``` so that if it sees any error, it disables the program so as not to cause problems with the user.
#### 2. I added a variable named ```open``` and gave it a value of ```True``` so that the decision loop keeps running and I have control over its closure.
#### 3. I created a ```While``` decision loop to keep the program running 
#### 4. I created a variable ```number``` so that I can compare after the entry with the following values ​​and added the function ```int``` so that it receives numbers only 
#### 5. Create the variable ```math``` to calculate for me this equation ```numbers % 2``` so that I can later specify the entry as an even or odd number.
#### 6. I created the condition ```if``` so that if the variable ```math``` is equal to ```0```, it prints to me that the number is even, and if it is equal to ```1``` then it is Individually, unless this or that is the case, the decision-making process stops
