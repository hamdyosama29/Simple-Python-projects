# 1. **Simple calculator**
#### 1. I added the function `try` so that if it encounters any error, it disables the program to prevent problems for the user.
#### 2. A variable named `Cal` was written. This variable contains `True` so that the loop runs all the time.
#### 3. A variable named `enter` has been declared so that I can receive the calculation from it later.
#### 4. I added the conditional expression `if` so that if a person wants to exit the program, they can type `exit`.
#### 5. I added another condition because I noticed that when I ran the program without this condition, there was a problem with the division. For example, if I wrote `10/2`, the output would appear as `5.0`. I don't want it to appear like this. I solved it by adding this condition: when pressing `/`, if it finds it, it replaces it with this command: `//`. This ensures the result of the division appears as `5`.
#### 6. If nothing happens, it converts the input into a number using the `eval` function so that I can calculate it.
#### 7. I added `except` to `try`, then I called this command from within `Exception` and stored it in a variable so that I could display the error message. I adjusted the message by adding the letter `f` to include the variable inside the text.

# 2. **Even and odd numbers testing program**
#### 1. I added the function ```try``` so that if it sees any error, it disables the program so as not to cause problems with the user.
#### 2. I added a variable named ```open``` and gave it a value of ```True``` so that the decision loop keeps running and I have control over its closure.
#### 3. I created a ```While``` decision loop to keep the program running 
#### 4. I created a variable ```number``` so that I can compare after the entry with the following values ​​and added the function ```int``` so that it receives numbers only 
#### 5. Create the variable ```math``` to calculate for me this equation ```numbers % 2``` so that I can later specify the entry as an even or odd number.
#### 6. I created the condition ```if``` so that if the variable ```math``` is equal to ```0```, it prints to me that the number is even, and if it is equal to ```1``` then it is Individually, unless this or that is the case, the decision-making process stops
